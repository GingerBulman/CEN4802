Software Integration, Configurations and Testing Class
My name is Zachary Bulman. I currently work full time at Publix and I'm pursuing my IST-BS here at Seminole State. I am taking this course to fulfill the graduation requirements for my degree. I only have four classes left to take and really looking forward to not doing any more school work. look forward to learning something new in this class.
